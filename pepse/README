In the tree package we created three classes,
the first is the flora whose responsibility is
to create the forest - the trees and the fruits
and place them. In fact, we have a main method in
it that randomly decides where to place the tree trunks,
for each trunk the height is also randomly selected,
and then according to the height we create a range to
create the leaves, which we create randomly by a constant
that defines the density of the leaves, and between the
empty places where we did not put leaves, we place the
fruits randomly again according to a constant
that defines density. We created two additional
classes Leaf, Fruit for the following reasons: First, it
is an object, and since, as we learned, we will want to maintain
encapsulation, meaning that each class has a defined and unique role.
The role of the Flora class is to create our "forest"
in the game, so creating the fruits and leaves is not its
responsibility, so we will want to create different classes
for them while maintaining a minimal API to the Flora class
as part of our principles. This will also allow the code to
be more readable since there are objects Instead of creating
a block until we get the object itself, and the very act of
creating these objects will make it easier for us to maintain and update
the code because if we want to change a detail in a particular
object, instead of searching for the appropriate line in Flora,
which is loaded with actions and functions unrelated to that object,
we can easily add a function to that object without too much effort.
This way we emphasize the main design principle - Open/Close
The Leaf class inherits from the Block class and is responsible for
how the leaf itself works. That is, when you create the leaf, you
add it to a ScheduledTask within that class. The process that will
be performed at the time that will be passed to each leaf will be a
callback to a function that was also created in the same class that
contains the two transitions that are performed for each leaf: changing
its width and moving its angle. The second class is Fruit, which inherits
from GameObject, which detects when a collision occurs whether the object
that collided is the avatar according to the tag, thus updating its energy,
adding 10 percent to it, and in addition, the fruit will be updated to disappear
for 10 seconds and prevent collisions with it as long as it disappears.
